# Work-and-Play Timer
A python script which logs time in one activity (e.g. work) and allows you to spend time for something else (e.g. videogames).

Spending time doing one thing will build up time allowed to be spent in the other, according to an adjustible modifier.

E.g. spending 60 minutes working (x 0.5) allows for 30 minutes of gametime.

Stores logged time and settings as a .txt file in AppData\Local\wp_timer or Documents\wp_timer depending on the OS.

Works on Windows and Mac. Haven't yet tested Linux, but it should work fine.


Currently runs in commandline as a python script.
Simply use 'python wp_timer.py'.
